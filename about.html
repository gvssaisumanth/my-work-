      <p>Naruto is the third best-selling manga series in history, selling 235 million copies worldwide in 35 countries. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.</p>
      <p>Characters
when he created Naruto, Kishimoto looked to other sh≈çnen manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while basing the story on Japanese culture.[11] The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another.[12] He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning with volume 28.[8] He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences.[13] As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the timeskip in order to have them age and become stronger during this time.</p>
