<p>The above image grabs a second of yours so as you can decode it to know what it is conveying .The character above is taken from a comic series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Naruto:_Shippuden_episodes">Naruto</a>which i consider worth watching and you will have a little glimpse of this character called ITACHI </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha">ITACHI UCHIHA</a>the so called rouge ninja in the first part of naruto series turns to be know as saviour of the vilage in second series who devotes everything for greater good and takes the blame of rouge to save his own clan which planned a coup d'etat on it's own village   </p>

<p>ITACHI UCHIHA is over talented and over mateured for his age he is the one who can be considered as unsung bird,who has a lot of prominence in the story ,he claims to walk in dark path but no one ever knew the distance he walked in dark was compensated by a vilage enlightment peace </p>
